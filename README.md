# Saurav's Low Level Design Template :computer: :rocket: 

The repository holds the implementation of Design Patterns in Java. Feel free to fork the repo and use
it for understanding, modifying and trying out the implementation in real time.

## Design Patterns implemented :fire:

### Singleton Pattern :lock:

1. Lazy Implementation [:link:](/Singleton%20Pattern/Lazy%20Initialization/)
2. Synchronized Implementation [:link:](/Singleton%20Pattern/Synchronized%20Implementation/)
3. Eager Implementation [:link:](/Singleton%20Pattern/Eager%20Initialization/)

### Decorator Pattern :art:

1. Alternate Implementation [:link:](/Decorator%20Pattern/Alternative%20Implementation/)
2. Headfirst Design Book Example [:link:](/Decorator%20Pattern/Headfirst%Design%20Book%20Example/)
3. Newsletter Example [:link:](/Decorator%20Pattern/Newsletter%20Example/)
    1. Class Explosion Implementation [:link:](/Decorator%20Pattern/Newsletter%20Example/Class%20Explosion%20Implementation/)
    2. Alternate Implementation (violates Open-Closed principle) [:link:](/Decorator%20Pattern/Newsletter%20Example/Alternate%20Implementation/)
    3. Effective Implementation (Decorator Pattern) [:link:](/Decorator%20Pattern/Newsletter%20Example/Effective%20Implementation/)

### Factory Pattern
